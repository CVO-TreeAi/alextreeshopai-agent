# Arboreal App Tutorial Analysis

## Comprehensive Usage Guide

### Core AR Measurement Process
1. **Mark the tree**: Go close to trunk (2-3 feet), aim camera at tree, press mark
2. **Move away**: Walk back approximately tree height distance 
3. **Mark base**: Aim at tree base, use zoom if needed, press mark
4. **Mark top**: Aim at tree top, press mark
5. **Save**: Name and save the measurement

### Critical Success Factors

#### Positioning Requirements
- Hold camera upright when walking away from tree
- Don't point camera to ground during movement
- Need clear view of both tree top and base
- Optimal distance: ~100 feet from tree for best accuracy
- Can use phone zoom for precise crosshair placement

#### Accuracy Optimization
- Don't drink coffee before precise measurements (steady hands)
- Consider tripod for high-precision needs
- Measurements within 1% of professional clinometer readings
- Always within 1-2 feet when cross-checked with drones/range finders
