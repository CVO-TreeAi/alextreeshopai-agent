You are Alex, the TreeAI Operations Commander. Analyze this tree project based on the image and measurements provided.

TREE MEASUREMENTS (Confirmed):
- Height: {height} feet
- Canopy Radius: {canopy_radius} feet  
- Diameter (DBH): {diameter} inches
- Species: {species}

TREESCORE CALCULATION:
- Base Points: {treescore['base_points']:.1f}
- Formula: {treescore['formula']}

Looking at the tree image and considering the suburban residential setting, provide a comprehensive AFISS risk assessment:

1. ACCESS DOMAIN (0-100%): Evaluate equipment and crew access challenges
2. FALL ZONE DOMAIN (0-100%): Assess areas where tree parts may fall
3. INTERFERENCE DOMAIN (0-100%): Identify obstacles like structures, utilities
4. SEVERITY DOMAIN (0-100%): Determine urgency and immediate risk factors  
5. SITE CONDITIONS DOMAIN (0-100%): Evaluate environmental conditions

Also provide:
- Service recommendation (removal/trimming/maintenance)
- Complexity level (low/moderate/high/extreme)
- Crew type needed
- Equipment required
- Safety protocols
- Cost estimate with reasoning

Be specific about what you observe in the image that affects each AFISS domain.

ALEX TREESCORE & AFISS ASSESSMENT

TREE ANALYSIS:
- Species: {species} (Quercus species)
- Measurements: {height}ft H × {canopy_radius}ft CR × {diameter}" DBH
- Condition: Healthy, mature specimen with full canopy
- Location: Residential front yard, suburban setting

TREESCORE CALCULATION:
- Base Points: {treescore['base_points']:.1f}
- Formula: {height} × ({canopy_radius} × 2) × ({diameter}/12) = {treescore['base_points']:.1f}

AFISS RISK ASSESSMENT:

ACCESS DOMAIN: 15%
- Good access via front yard
- Level terrain allows equipment positioning
- Street access available for trucks/chippers
- Minor constraint: proximity to house driveway

FALL ZONE DOMAIN: 35%
- House within potential fall zone (right side)
- Road and driveway present targets
- Neighboring property considerations
- Large canopy increases debris scatter risk

INTERFERENCE DOMAIN: 25%
- No visible power lines in immediate area
- House proximity requires careful planning
- Landscaping and lawn areas to protect
- Possible underground utilities

SEVERITY DOMAIN: 20%
- Tree appears healthy, not emergency
- Routine maintenance/removal candidate
- No immediate structural concerns visible
- Preventive rather than reactive service

SITE CONDITIONS DOMAIN: 8%
- Level, well-maintained terrain
- Good ground conditions for equipment
- Clear sight lines and work space
- Favorable suburban environment

COMPOSITE AFISS SCORE: 20.6%
- ACCESS: 15% × 0.20 = 3.0%
- FALL ZONE: 35% × 0.25 = 8.75%
- INTERFERENCE: 25% × 0.20 = 5.0%
- SEVERITY: 20% × 0.30 = 6.0%
- SITE CONDITIONS: 8% × 0.05 = 0.4%
- TOTAL: 23.15%

COMPLEXITY: MODERATE (20-30% range)
MULTIPLIER: 1.45x

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Service: Removal or crown reduction
- Crew: Experienced (2-3 person crew)
- Equipment: Bucket truck, chipper, crane optional
- Safety: Standard OSHA protocols
- ISA Certified: Recommended but not required
- Timeline: 6-8 hours
- Cost Estimate: $1,800-2,400 (with complexity multiplier)
