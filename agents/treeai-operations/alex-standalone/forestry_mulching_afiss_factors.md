# AFISS Factors for Forestry Mulching Operations

## Overview
Assessment Factor Identification and Scoring System (AFISS) specifically designed for forestry mulching projects using package-based pricing (4", 6", 8", 10" DBH limits) and production rates measured in inch-acres per hour (ia/h).

**IMPORTANT:** AFISS factors adjust PRODUCTION RATE (ia/h), not billing rate. Factors can be POSITIVE (increase production) or NEGATIVE (decrease production) based on site conditions that affect TIME to complete work.

## Calculation Framework
```
Adjusted Production Rate = Base Rate × (1 + Sum of AFISS Factor Adjustments)

Example: 1.5 ia/h base × (1 + (-0.25 Brazilian pepper factor)) = 1.125 ia/h adjusted
Example: 1.5 ia/h base × (1 + (-0.25 Brazilian pepper) + (-0.15 steep slope) + (+0.10 dry conditions)) = 1.05 ia/h adjusted
```

## DBH Verification Method
DBH verification uses push bar indicators on mulcher attachments to measure diameter before cutting.

## AFISS Production Rate Calculation Examples

### Basic Calculation:
```
Adjusted Production Rate = Base Rate × (1 + Sum of AFISS Factor Adjustments)
```

### Example 1: Brazilian Pepper Site
- Base Rate: 1.5 ia/h
- Brazilian pepper infestation (moderate): -25%
- Wet soil conditions: -20%
- Complex site layout: -15%

**Calculation:** 1.5 × (1 + (-0.25) + (-0.20) + (-0.15)) = 1.5 × 0.40 = 0.60 ia/h

### Example 2: Ideal Conditions Site
- Base Rate: 1.5 ia/h
- Thin vegetation: +15%
- Ideal terrain: +10%
- Dry conditions: +5%
- Large simple area: +10%

**Calculation:** 1.5 × (1 + (+0.15) + (+0.10) + (+0.05) + (+0.10)) = 1.5 × 1.40 = 2.10 ia/h

### Example 3: Mixed Conditions Site
- Base Rate: 1.5 ia/h
- Steep slopes: -20%
- Overhead utilities: -15%
- Emergency conditions: +10%

**Calculation:** 1.5 × (1 + (-0.20) + (-0.15) + (+0.10)) = 1.5 × 0.75 = 1.125 ia/h

## DBH Package Integration

### Package Difficulty Factors (Applied AFTER AFISS Adjustments):
**CORRECTED: Larger diameter = harder to cut = lower production rate**

- **4" Package:** Adjusted rate × 1.0 (baseline - easiest)
- **6" Package:** Adjusted rate × 0.77 (23% slower than 4")
- **8" Package:** Adjusted rate × 0.63 (37% slower than 4")  
- **10" Package:** Adjusted rate × 0.50 (50% slower than 4")

### Example with DBH Package:
- Base Rate: 1.5 ia/h
- Brazilian pepper: -25%
- 6" DBH Package

**Calculation:** 1.5 × (1 + (-0.25)) × 0.77 = 1.125 × 0.77 = 0.87 ia/h

## Factor Application Guidelines

### NEGATIVE FACTORS (Decrease Production Rate):
- **Maximum combined negative factors:** -70% (minimum 30% of base rate)
- **Typical range:** -20% to -50% total negative factors
- **Critical factors:** Brazilian pepper (-25% to -30%), extreme terrain (-25%), poor soil (-30%)

### POSITIVE FACTORS (Increase Production Rate):
- **Maximum combined positive factors:** +40% (maximum 140% of base rate)
- **Typical range:** +5% to +25% total positive factors
- **Key factors:** Thin vegetation (+20%), ideal terrain (+15%), large areas (+15%)

### Factor Interaction Rules:
1. **Additive System:** All applicable factors are summed algebraically
2. **Minimum Rate:** Never reduce below 30% of base rate (0.3x multiplier minimum)
3. **Maximum Rate:** Never exceed 140% of base rate (1.4x multiplier maximum)
4. **Conflicting Factors:** Use most applicable factor when conditions conflict

## Implementation Notes

1. **Site Assessment:** Thoroughly evaluate all conditions before applying factors
2. **Documentation:** Record which factors were applied and why for client communication
3. **Regional Adjustment:** Base rates and factors may need regional calibration
4. **Equipment Specific:** Some factors vary by mulcher type and size
5. **Seasonal Considerations:** Weather and access factors change seasonally
6. **Client Communication:** Use factor breakdown to explain production rate variations
7. **Continuous Improvement:** Update factors based on actual project performance data

This AFISS system provides a comprehensive, standardized method for adjusting forestry mulching production rates based on site-specific conditions that affect the time required to complete work.
