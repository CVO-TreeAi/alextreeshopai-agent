# AR Stump Grinding Tool - Workflow Analysis

## Core Concept: AI-Powered Stump Analysis & Workflow Automation

### Tool Vision
AR scanning tool that identifies stumps, analyzes grinding requirements, and completes entire workflow from scan to invoice - all offline-capable with minimal battery usage.

## Stump Grinding Business Workflow Integration

Based on AlexTreeShopAi capabilities, the tool should integrate with:

### 1. Lead Generation & Assessment
- **Scan-to-Lead**: AR scan creates automatic lead entry
- **GPS Integration**: Auto-populate customer address from location
- **Photo Documentation**: Capture stump conditions for estimates

### 2. TreeScore & Pricing for Stumps
- **StumpScore Algorithm**: Size, species, root system complexity, access difficulty
- **AI Pricing Engine**: Instant quotes based on scan analysis
- **AFISS Integration**: Safety risk assessment for stump locations

### 3. Work Order Creation
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Based on stump size and equipment availability
- **Equipment Recommendation**: Grinder size, additional tools needed
- **Crew Assignment**: Skill level required based on complexity

### 4. Business Intelligence
- **Profitability Analysis**: Per-stump metrics and trends
- **Equipment Utilization**: Grinder efficiency tracking
- **Route Optimization**: Multiple stump jobs in area

## AR Tool Workflow Design

### Phase 1: Scan & Identify
```
1. Launch AR tool
2. Point camera at stump
3. AI identifies:
   - Stump diameter (surface & estimated root ball)
   - Tree species (from stump characteristics)
   - Root system complexity
   - Access difficulty factors
   - Surrounding obstacles
4. Auto-capture measurements and photos
```

### Phase 2: Analysis & Assessment
```
1. AI calculates:
   - Grinding time estimate
   - Equipment requirements
   - Access challenges
   - Safety considerations
   - Material disposal volume
2. Generate StumpScore (similar to TreeScore)
3. Risk assessment (AFISS-style)
```

### Phase 3: Workflow Automation
```
1. Auto-create customer lead
2. Generate pricing estimate
3. Create work order draft
4. Schedule equipment/crew
5. Prepare invoice template
6. Save to project pipeline
```

## AI Visual Identification Requirements

### Computer Vision Tasks
- **Stump Detection**: Edge detection and circular recognition
- **Diameter Measurement**: AR-based measurement overlay
- **Species Identification**: Bark pattern, grain pattern, color analysis
- **Root System Assessment**: Surface root visibility, species-based root patterns
- **Obstacle Detection**: Fences, buildings, utilities, landscaping
- **Ground Condition**: Slope, soil type, accessibility

### Machine Learning Models Needed
- **Stump Classification**: Species identification from visual characteristics
- **Size Estimation**: Accurate diameter and depth prediction
- **Complexity Scoring**: Root system difficulty assessment
- **Access Analysis**: Equipment path and setup space evaluation

## Offline & Battery Optimization

### Core Requirements
- **Full Offline Operation**: No internet required for scanning/analysis
- **Low Battery Usage**: Optimized AR rendering, background processing
- **Local AI Models**: On-device computer vision and analysis
- **Sync When Available**: Upload data when connectivity restored

### Technical Approach
- **Edge AI**: TensorFlow Lite models for on-device processing
- **Efficient AR**: ARKit/ARCore optimizations for battery life
- **Local Storage**: SQLite for offline data persistence
- **Background Sync**: Queue uploads for when online
