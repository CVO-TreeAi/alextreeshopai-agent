### Example 2: TreeScore Calculation Display

**Human Input**:
```
Create a TreeScore visualization component that shows real-time score calculations with component breakdowns, progress indicators, and comparison capabilities.
```

**Automated Workflow**:
1. **Requirements Analysis** identifies need for calculation engine + visualization
2. **Agent Assignment**:
   - Forms Workflow Specialist: Calculation logic and business rules
   - SwiftUI Component Architect: Visualization components
