## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Hidden Cost Crisis
Most tree service operations severely underestimate their true equipment costs, leading to:
- **Unprofitable pricing:** Bidding below actual costs
- **Cash flow problems:** Equipment replacement funds depleted
- **Competitive disadvantage:** Inability to invest in modern equipment
- **Business failure:** 60% of tree services fail within 5 years due to poor cost understanding

### The Solution: Equipment Cost Intelligence
TreeAI's Equipment Cost Intelligence system implements U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) methodology adapted for tree service operations, providing:
- **True hourly costs** for all equipment categories
- **Automated AI lookups** for specifications and market data
- **Severity factor adjustments** based on work conditions
- **Small tools pool management** for complete cost capture

### Key Benefits
- **Accurate pricing:** Know your true costs before bidding
- **Profit optimization:** Price with confidence for target margins
- **Equipment planning:** Make informed purchase/lease decisions
- **Competitive advantage:** Price accurately while competitors guess

## USACE METHODOLOGY FRAMEWORK

### Foundation Principle
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers developed EP-1110-1-8 methodology for accurate equipment costing in construction operations. TreeAI adapts this proven framework for tree service equipment.

### Two-Component Structure

**1. OWNERSHIP COSTS** (Fixed costs regardless of usage)
- Depreciation
- Interest/Cost of Capital
- Insurance, Taxes, Storage

**2. OPERATING COSTS** (Variable costs based on usage)
- Fuel
- Lubrication
- Repairs & Maintenance
- Wear Parts (tires, tracks, cutting components)

### Formula Framework
```
Total Cost/Hour = Ownership Cost/Hour + Operating Cost/Hour

Where:
Ownership Cost/Hour = DEPR/hr + INT/hr + I&T&S/hr
Operating Cost/Hour = Fuel/hr + Lube/hr + R&M/hr + Wear/hr
```

## SMALL TOOLS & CONSUMABLES POOL

### Philosophy
Rather than tracking every small item individually, TreeAI uses a pool-based approach that captures all small tool costs while minimizing administrative burden.

### Categories and Defaults

#### 1. Chainsaws & Power Tools
**Items:** Chainsaws, pole saws, blowers, hedge trimmers  
**Basis:** Per unit  
**Average Cost:** $1,000 per unit  
**Expected Life:** 2 years (2,400 hours)  
**Cost per Hour:** $0.42/hr per unit

**Calculation:**
```
Annual Cost = $1,000 ÷ 2 years = $500/year
Hourly Cost = $500 ÷ 1,200 hours = $0.42/hr
```

#### 2. Climbing Gear
**Items:** Rope, saddle, helmet, carabiners, lanyards  
**Basis:** Per climber  
**Average Cost:** $1,500 per complete set  
**Expected Life:** 3 years  
**Cost per Hour:** $0.42/hr per climber

#### 3. Hand Tools
**Items:** Loppers, hand saws, rakes, wedges  
**Basis:** Per crew  
**Average Cost:** $400 per crew set  
**Expected Life:** 2 years  
**Cost per Hour:** $0.17/hr per crew

#### 4. Safety Gear
**Items:** Helmets, gloves, eye protection, hearing protection  
**Basis:** Per person  
**Average Cost:** $300 per person annually  
**Expected Life:** 1 year  
**Cost per Hour:** $0.25/hr per person

#### 5. Rigging Gear
**Items:** Slings, blocks, pulleys, rigging ropes  
**Basis:** Per crew

**Expected Life:** 3 months  
**Cost per Hour:** $0.10/hr per person

### Pool Calculation Example
**Crew Configuration:**
- 2 climbers
- 2 ground crew
- 4 chainsaws total
- 1 crew unit

**Small Tools Cost Calculation:**
```
Chainsaws: 4 units × $0.42/hr = $1.68/hr
Climbing Gear: 2 climbers × $0.42/hr = $0.84/hr
Hand Tools: 1 crew × $0.17/hr = $0.17/hr
Safety Gear: 4 people × $0.25/hr = $1.00/hr
Rigging Gear: 1 crew × $0.28/hr = $0.28/hr
Small Tools Fuel: 1 crew × $0.33/hr = $0.33/hr
PPE Consumables: 4 people × $0.10/hr = $0.40/hr

Total Small Tools Pool: $4.70/hr
```

## COST CALCULATION PROCEDURES

### Step 1: Equipment Identification
1. **Catalog all equipment** in your operation
2. **Classify by category** (use TreeAI categories)
3. **Record key specifications:**
   - Make, model, year
   - Purchase price (or current market value)
   - Engine specifications
   - Special attachments

### Step 2: Ownership Cost Calculation

#### Depreciation per Hour
```
DEPR/hr = (Purchase Price - Salvage Value) ÷ Expected Life Hours

Example: Bucket Truck
DEPR/hr = ($165,000 - $49,500) ÷ 10,000 = $11.55/hr
```

#### Interest/Cost of Capital per Hour
```
INT/hr = (Average Investment × Interest Rate) ÷ Annual Hours

Where: Average Investment = (Purchase Price + Salvage Value) ÷ 2

Example: Bucket Truck
Average Investment = ($165,000 + $49,500) ÷ 2 = $107,250
INT/hr = ($107,250 × 6%) ÷ 1,200 = $5.36/hr
```

#### Insurance, Taxes, Storage per Hour
```
I&T&S/hr = (Purchase Price × 3% annually) ÷ Annual Hours

Example: Bucket Truck
I&T&S/hr = ($165,000 × 3%) ÷ 1,200 = $4.13/hr
```

### Step 3: Operating Cost Calculation

#### Fuel Cost per Hour
```
Fuel/hr = Fuel Burn Rate (gph) × Current Fuel Price ($/gal)

Example: Bucket Truck
Fuel/hr = 6.5 gph × $4.25/gal = $27.63/hr
```

#### Lubrication Cost per Hour
```
Lube/hr = Fuel Cost/hr × 15%

Example: Bucket Truck
Lube/hr = $27.63 × 15% = $4.14/hr
```

#### Repairs & Maintenance per Hour
```
R&M/hr = Depreciation/hr × Maintenance Factor

Example: Bucket Truck (60% maintenance factor)
R&M/hr = $11.55 × 60% = $6.93/hr
```

#### Wear Parts per Hour
```
Wear/hr = Depreciation/hr × 20%

Example: Bucket Truck
Wear/hr = $11.55 × 20% = $2.31/hr
```

### Step 4: Total Cost Assembly
```
Total Equipment Cost/hr = Ownership Cost/hr + Operating Cost/hr

Example: Bucket Truck
Ownership: $11.55 + $5.36 + $4.13 = $21.04/hr
Operating: $27.63 + $4.14 + $6.93 + $2.31 = $41.01/hr
Total: $62.05/hr
```

### Application of Severity Factors
Apply severity multipliers to:
- ✅ **Repairs & Maintenance costs**
- ✅ **Wear parts costs**
- ❌ **NOT to depreciation or fuel costs** (these remain constant)

**Example: Chipper in Heavy Vegetation**
```
Base R&M cost: $6.75/hr
Heavy Vegetation Factor: 1.25x
Adjusted R&M cost: $6.75 × 1.25 = $8.44/hr

Base Wear Parts: $1.50/hr
Adjusted Wear Parts: $1.50 × 1.25 = $1.88/hr

Total Adjustment: +$2.07/hr
```
